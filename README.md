# Dodocoin-Blockchain


This project implements the functionality of a typical block of a blockchain. This contains header
information (index, timestamp, previous block hash, Merkle root, etc.) which is used to generate a
hash for this block.

It also contains a list of the transactions that are part of this block.

It implements the functionality of generating both Merkle root and hash of a block with a defined
difficulty level.
